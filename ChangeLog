1.36	6/6/98 Substantial API changes:
	1. row() now returns everything to the right of the current object INCLUSIVE
	of the object.  Calling row() in a scalar context returns the size of the
	array, not the first member of the array.

	2. col() now takes an optional numeric argument indicating how far to the
	right in the tree to go.  Specifically col(2) implements tag[2] semantics.

	3. search() now takes an optional numeric argument indicating how
 	far to the right in the tree to go before retrieving the column.
	Specifically, search($tag,2) implements tag[2] semantics.

	4. automatically-generated methods (such as Homol) now take an optional
	numeric argument that is passed to search.  $obj->Homol(2) implements
	tag[2] semantics.

	5. fetch() now takes an optional tag argument which will be followed
	prior to fetching from the database.  $obj->fetch('Laboratory') will
	return the Laboratory object.

	6. tace can be used to access local databases, by passing a -path
 	argument to the Ace::connect() method.

	7. dates are displayed in Java style (3 March 1998 hh:mm:ss) by 
	default.  This can be altered with a call to Ace::date_style().

	8. Default port has changed to 23456
