1.52	1/21/99
	1. Fixed bad bug in the kill method which caused objects
	to be removed from the database seemingly randomly.
	2. Optimized tag searching to improve performance when
	navigating objects.
	3. Better error message reporting when objects do not contain
	a desired tag.
1.51	12/14/98
	1. Comparison between objects now is more sensible:
	"eq" performs a string comparison on object names
	"==" performs an object comparison.  Two objects are
	identical iff their names, classes and databases are identical
	2. Fixed bugs involving names containing "*" and "?" characters.
	3. Added the -long option to grep.
	4. Added the -display option to asGIF()
	5. The follow() method now follows a tag into the database.
1.50    10/28.98
	1. THE SEMANTICS OF AUTOGENERATED FUNCTIONS HAS CHANGED.  THEY NOW
	ALWAYS DEREFERENCE THE TAG AND FETCH AN OBJECT FROM THE DATABASE.
	2. Added the Ace::put() function to the Ace object, allowing you to move
	objects from one database to another.
	3. Added Ace::Object::add_row() and add_tree() functions, making it easier to build
	up objects from scratch, or to mix and match objects from different databases.
        4. Added Ace::parse() and parse_file() methods, for creating objects from .ace files.
	5. Removed nulls from error strings.

1.39	1. Workaround for problem with dropped date fields

1.38	1. list() is now deprecated.  Use fetch() instead

	2. Added -filled and -chunksize arguments to fetch_many().
	3. Quashed a bug in list(-filled).
	4. More regression tests.
	
1.36	6/6/98 Substantial API changes:
	1. row() now returns everything to the right of the current object INCLUSIVE
	of the object.  Calling row() in a scalar context returns the size of the
	array, not the first member of the array.

	2. col() now takes an optional numeric argument indicating how far to the
	right in the tree to go.  Specifically col(2) implements tag[2] semantics.

	3. search() now takes an optional numeric argument indicating how
 	far to the right in the tree to go before retrieving the column.
	Specifically, search($tag,2) implements tag[2] semantics.

	4. automatically-generated methods (such as Homol) now take an optional
	numeric argument that is passed to search.  $obj->Homol(2) implements
	tag[2] semantics.

	5. fetch() now takes an optional tag argument which will be followed
	prior to fetching from the database.  $obj->fetch('Laboratory') will
	return the Laboratory object.

	6. tace can be used to access local databases, by passing a -path
 	argument to the Ace::connect() method.

	7. dates are displayed in Java style (3 March 1998 hh:mm:ss) by 
	default.  This can be altered with a call to Ace::date_style().

	8. Default port has changed to 23456

1.34    5/20/98 Fixed bug in Ace.xs caused by 1.33 change!  Only some objects
	were retrieved by fetch().

1.33    5/19/98 Fixed bug in Ace.xs that caused client to crash on "quit" query.

1.01	3/20/98 Fixed bug in _appendToTable() routine that caused asHTML to hang.

1.00	2/25/98 First released version
