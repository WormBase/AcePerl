=head1 NAME

Ace::Graphics::Glyph - Base class for Ace::Graphics::Glyph objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<Ace::Graphics::Panel>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Ace::Graphics::Glyph is the base class for all glyph objects.  Each
glyph is a wrapper around an Ace::Sequence::Feature object, knows how
to render itself on an Ace::Graphics::Panel, and has a variety of
configuration variables.

End developers will not ordinarily work directly with
Ace::Graphics::Glyph, but may want to subclass it for customized
displays.

=head1 METHODS

This section describes the class and object methods for
Ace::Graphics::Glyph.

=head2 CONSTRUCTORS

Ace::Graphics::Glyph objects are constructed automatically by an
Ace::Graphics::GlyphFactory, and are not usually created by
end-developer code.

=over 4

=item $glyph = Ace::Graphics::Glyph->new(-feature=>$feature,-factory=>$factory)

Given a sequence feature, creates an Ace::Graphics::Glyph object to
display it.  The -feature argument points to the
Ace::Sequence::Feature object to display.  -factory indicates an
Ace::Graphics::GlyphFactory object from which the glyph will fetch all
its run-time configuration information.

A standard set of options are recognized.  See L<OPTIONS>.

=back

=head2 OBJECT METHODS

Once a glyph is created, it responds to a large number of methods.  In
this section, these methods are grouped into related categories.

Retrieving glyph context:

=over 4

=item $factory = $glyph->factory

Get the Ace::Graphics::GlyphFactory associated with this object.  This
cannot be changed once it is set.

=item $feature = $glyph->feature

Get the sequence feature associated with this object.  This cannot be
changed once it is set.

=back

Retrieving glyph options:

=over 4

=item $fgcolor = $glyph->fgcolor

=item $bgcolor = $glyph->bgcolor

=item $fontcolor = $glyph->fontcolor

=item $fillcolor = $glyph->fillcolor

These methods return the configured foreground, background, font and
fill colors for the glyph in the form of a GD::Image color index.

=item $width = $glyph->width

Return the maximum width allowed for the glyph.  Most glyphs will be
smaller than this.

=item $font = $glyph->font

Return the font for the glyph.

=item $option = $glyph->option($option)

Return the value of the indicated option.

=item $index = $glyph->color($color)

Given a symbolic or #RRGGBB-form color name, returns its GD index.

=back


Retrieving information about the sequence:

=over 4

=item $start = $glyph->start

=item $end   = $glyph->end

These methods return the start and end of the glyph in base pair
units.

=item $offset = $glyph->offset

Returns the offset of the segment (the base pair at the far left of
the image).

=item $length = $glyph->length

Returns the length of the sequence segment.

=back


Retrieving formatting information:

=over 4

=item $top = $glyph->top

=item $left = $glyph->left

=item $bottom = $glyph->bottom

=item $right = $glyph->right

These methods return the top, left, bottom and right of the glyph in
pixel coordinates.

=item $height = $glyph->height

Returns the height of the glyph.  This may be somewhat larger or
smaller than the height suggested by the GlyphFactory, depending on
the type of the glyph.

=item $scale = $glyph->scale

Get the scale for the glyph in pixels/bp.

=item $height = $glyph->labelheight

Return the height of the label, if any.

=item $label = $glyph->label

Return a human-readable label for the glyph.

=back

These methods are called by Ace::Graphics::Track during the layout
process:

=over 4

=item $glyph->move($dx,$dy)

Move the glyph in pixel coordinates by the indicated delta-x and
delta-y values.

=item ($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2) = $glyph->box

Return the current position of the glyph.

=back

These methods are intended to be overridden in subclasses:

=over 4

=item $glyph->calculate_height

Calculate the height of the glyph.

=item $glyph->calculate_left

Calculate the left side of the glyph.

=item $glyph->calculate_right

Calculate the right side of the glyph.

=item $glyph->draw($gd,$left,$top)

Optionally offset the glyph by the indicated amount and draw it onto
the GD::Image object.


=item $glyph->draw_label($gd,$left,$top)

Draw the label for the glyph onto the provided GD::Image object,
optionally offsetting by the amounts indicated in $left and $right.

=back

These methods are useful utility routines:

=over 4

=item $pixels = $glyph->map_pt($bases);

Map the indicated base position, given in base pair units, into
pixels, using the current scale and glyph position.

=item $glyph->filled_box($gd,$x1,$y1,$x2,$y2)

Draw a filled rectangle with the appropriate foreground and fill
colors, and pen width onto the GD::Image object given by $gd, using
the provided rectangle coordinates.

=item $glyph->filled_oval($gd,$x1,$y1,$x2,$y2)

As above, but draws an oval inscribed on the rectangle.

=back

=head2 OPTIONS

The following options are standard among all Glyphs.  See individual
glyph pages for more options.

  Option      Description               Default
  ------      -----------               -------

  -fgcolor    Foreground color		black

  -outlinecolor				black
	      Synonym for -fgcolor

  -bgcolor    Background color          white

  -fillcolor  Interior color of filled  turquoise
	      images

  -linewidth  Width of lines drawn by	1
		    glyph

  -height     Height of glyph		10

  -font       Glyph font		gdSmallFont

  -label      Whether to draw a label	false

You may pass an anonymous subroutine to -label, in which case the
subroutine will be invoked with the feature as its single argument.
The subroutine must return a string to render as the label.

=head1 SUBCLASSING Ace::Graphics::Glyph

By convention, subclasses are all lower-case.  Begin each subclass
with a preamble like this one:

 package Ace::Graphics::Glyph::crossbox;

 use strict;
 use vars '@ISA';
 @ISA = 'Ace::Graphics::Glyph';

Then override the methods you need to.  Typically, just the draw()
method will need to be overridden.  However, if you need additional
room in the glyph, you may override calculate_height(),
calculate_left() and calculate_right().  Do not directly override
height(), left() and right(), as their purpose is to cache the values
returned by their calculating cousins in order to avoid time-consuming
recalculation.

A simple draw() method looks like this:

 sub draw {
  my $self = shift;
  $self->SUPER::draw(@_);
  my $gd = shift;

  # and draw a cross through the box
  my ($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2) = $self->calculate_boundaries(@_);
  my $fg = $self->fgcolor;
  $gd->line($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2,$fg);
  $gd->line($x1,$y2,$x2,$y1,$fg);
 }

This subclass draws a simple box with two lines criss-crossed through
it.  We first call our inherited draw() method to generate the filled
box and label.  We then call calculate_boundaries() to return the
coordinates of the glyph, disregarding any extra space taken by
labels.  We call fgcolor() to return the desired foreground color, and
then call $gd->line() twice to generate the criss-cross.

For more complex draw() methods, see Ace::Graphics::Glyph::transcript
and Ace::Graphics::Glyph::segments.
