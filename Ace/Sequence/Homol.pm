=head1 NAME

Ace::Sequence::Homol - Temporary Sequence Homology Class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Get all similarity features from an Ace::Sequence
    @homol = $seq->features('Similarity');

    # sort by score
    @sorted = sort { $a->score <=> $b->score } @homol;

    # the last one has the highest score
    $best = $sorted[$#sorted];

    # fetch its associated Ace::Sequence::Homol
    $homol = $best->target;

    # print out the sequence name, DNA, start and end
    print $homol->name,' ',$homol->start,'-',$homol->end,"\n";
    print $homol->asDNA;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<Ace::Sequence::Homol> is a subclass of L<Ace::Object> (B<not>
L<Ace::Sequence>) which is specialized for returning information about
a DNA or protein homology.  This is a temporary placeholder for a more
sophisticated homology class which will include support for
alignments.

=head1 OBJECT CREATION

You will not ordinarily create an I<Ace::Sequence::Homol> object
directly.  Instead, objects will be created in response to an info()
or group() method call on a similarity feature in an
I<Ace::Sequence::Feature> object.  If you wish to create an
I<Ace::Sequence::Homol> object directly, please consult the source
code for the I<new()> method.

=head1 OBJECT METHODS

Most methods are inherited from I<Ace::Object>.  The following
methods are also supported:

=over 4

=item start()

  $start = $homol->start;

Returns the start of the area that is similar to the
I<Ace::Sequence::Feature> from which his homology was derived.
Coordinates are relative to the target homology.

=item end()

  $end = $homol->end;

Returns the end of the area that is similar to the
I<Ace::Sequence::Feature> from which his homology was derived.
Coordinates are relative to the target homology.

=item asString()

  $label = $homol->asString;

Returns a human-readable identifier describing the nature of the
feature.  The format is:

 $name/$start-$end

for example:

 HUMGEN13/1-67

This method is also called automatically when the object is treated in
a string context.
